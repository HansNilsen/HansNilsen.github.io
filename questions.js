// DND morality questions

//TWO: Upon trying to enter a village, you are stopped by a sleazy-looking guard at the gate.  He demands you pay a toll before entering.  Which option describes what you would most likely do?

// 1) I'd pay the toll.
// 2) I'd argue with the guard, but if he won't budge, I'll end up paying.
// 3) I'd try and bribe the guard or use a charisma check to convince him to waive the toll for an absolute stud like me.
// 4) I'd threaten him, then attack him if he refuses to let me through.
// 5) I'd rally the nearby townsfolk and peasants into a mob, then lead them in a march on the city gates and let the ensuing anarchy clear a path for me.

//THREE: You are returning from an adventure on a relatively safe road, with one expensive and powerful health potion left in your inventory.  You encounter a gravely wounded man who begs you for help.  Which option best describes what you woul do?
// 1) I'd give him my health potion, without question.
// 2) I wouldn't want to give up my health potion, but I'd offer to escort him to the nearest village or give him some of my less valuable supplies.
// 3) I'd shrug, say I wish there was more I could do, then continue on my way.
// 4) I'd make fun of him, then offer him the potion, but only if he's able to offer some handsome compensation in return.
// 5) I'd mug him and steal anything of value on him, then tell him how ugly he is.

//FOUR: After being offered a handsome reward to do so by the local village elders, you are hunting the captain of a clan of bandits.  Upon his capture, he gives you a counteroffer: he'll triple the amount of gold the village promised if you free him.  Additionally, if you help him sack the village, he'll give you quadruple the amount.  What would you do?

// 1) Never!  I'm bringing this scum to justice.
// 2) I'd accept the offer to free him, but only if he promises to renounce the bandit's life and never hurt anyone again.
// 3) I'd free him, but I wouldn't help him sack anyone.
// 4) I'd take both offers.
// 5) I'd accept the deal, kill him, then usurp control over his bandit clan and attempt to conquer the whole province.

//FIVE: Would you ever cheat in an academic setting?
// 1) Never.
// 2) I'm against it, but if I'm really stressed out, the outcome is significant enough, and I'm positive I can get away with it, I'd probably give into the temptation.
// 3) Only on trivial things, if I'm stressed out and just need to get an assignment out of the way.
// 4) Only occasionally to bump up my grade and ensure I don't fail, but I'd still make sure I do most of the work and learn the material.
// 5) I'd gladly cheat on anything without a second thought.

//SIX: Inside a department store operated by a prosperous nationwide corporate chain you notice someone successfully shoplift an item of value from the store and leave without suspicion.  Thoughts?
// 1) Scumbag.
// 2) Slight disapproval.
// 3) I don't care.
// 4) Amusement.
// 5) Admiration.

//SEVEN: You are given no information about a person EXCEPT that they have served prison time for a crime they committed.  What is your first impression?
// 1) That's not good - I hope they've reformed, but I'd have very little respect for them.
// 2) It would make me wary, but I'd keep an open mind.
// 3) I don't care.
// 4) I'd be curious and want to get to know them better - they sound exciting.
// 5) They're most likely justified or wrongly convicted - my opinion of them would start off high.

//EIGHT: When you hear the word "revolution" what word best describes your immediate reaction?
// 1) Visceral disgust
// 2) I roll my eyes
// 3) Nothing, I'll hear them out
// 4) No idea what they want, but I'm probably down
// 5) It was probably me who said it

//NINE: Which faction of a fictional universe would you be most likely to join?
// 1) The noble town guard of a well-respected city
// 2) Rebels fighting for freedom from an oppressive dictator
// 3) Keep me out of it, I'd mind my own business
// 4) The secret police of an autocratic government
// 5) A clan of violent, greedy, marauding bandits

// 1) The Galactic Empire is my ideal political system.
// 2) There is never an excuse to commit crime, no matter what the reason.
// 3) Breaking the law is never acceptable except in extreme circumstances, such as in the face of tyranny, severe oppression, or immediate physical harm to innocent people.
// 4) Civil disobedience - breaking the law - should be encouraged if it aims to challenge an unjust law, even if that law causes no *physical* harm to anyone.

//ONE: Choose the statement with which you agree the most.
// 1) Breaking the law is never acceptable.
// 2) Breaking the law is only acceptable in extreme circumstances.
// 3) Breaking the law is occasionally acceptable.
// 4) Breaking the law is generally acceptable.
// 5) What the law is bears no significance in my decision making.
